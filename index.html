										The California College of the Arts (CCA) has selected 3 top firms as finalists to design “a new, ground-breaking art school that will redefine 21st century arts education.” Chosen from an original pool of 75 architects, the three firms will now interview for the chance to design a new campus that aims to unify the college’s Oakland and San Francisco campuses into one vibrant Bay Area institution.</p>

										<p>
											The chosen firm will work together with the school over the next five years to create a plan that will bring together 2,000 students, 600 faculty members, 250 staff members, and 34 academic programs to a consolidated campus located at the intersection of the city’s innovation corridor, the new DoReMi (Dogpatch, Potrero Hill, Mission) arts district, and Mission Bay. The primary project site will be a 2.4-acre lot that borders the college’s existing San Francisco campus buildings. The campus will house all of CCA’s programs, including art, crafts, design, architecture and writing, fostering interaction between the different disciplines.</p>

						<h2>Styles Of Architecture:</h2>
						<p class="lead"><h5>Indian architecture is that vast tapestry of production of the Indian Subcontinent that encompasses a multitude of expressions over space and time, transformed by the forces of history considered unique to the sub-continent, sometimes destroying, but most of the time absorbing. The result is an evolving range of architectural production that none the less retains a certain amount of continuity across history.

									<p>The cave architecture in India is believed to have begun in the third century BC. These caves were used by Buddhist and Jain monks as places of worship and residence. Initially the caves were excavated in the western India. Some examples of this type of cave structure are Chaityas and Viharas of Buddhists.</p>

The rock-cut art is more similar to sculpture than architecture as structures were produced by cutting out solid rocks.</p>

The colonial architecture exhibited itself through institutional, civic and utilitarian buildings such as post offices, railway stations, rest houses and government buildings. Such buildings began to be built in large numbers over the whole empire. </p>

									<p>Gothic architecture is a style of architecture that flourished during the high and late medieval period. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, Gothic architecture was known during the period as Opus Francigenum ("French work") with the term Gothic first appearing during the later part of the Renaissance.</p>

									<p>Baroque architecture is the building style of the Baroque era, begun in late 16th-century Italy, that took the Roman vocabulary of Renaissance architecture and used it in a new rhetorical and theatrical fashion, often to express the triumph of the Catholic Church and the absolutist state. It was characterized by new explorations of form, light and shadow, and dramatic intensity.</p>

											<p>weeping changes to our cityscape, water bodies and commons have taken place in less than two decades. It is in this context that it became important for the Centre for Vernacular Architecture to publish this edition. The urban landscape being fundamentally transformed into something completely unrelated to culture, climate or traditions of this part of the world, has made this book written more than two decades ago, most relevant today. This hubris of post industrial destruction and violence that civilizations outside the west face today has also produced a veritable crescendo of voices, concerns and protests that resonate with Illich's comment made many years ago — Modernity cherishes most what it destroys. It is this paradox that has been one of Illich's life long concerns. In many ways this book explores this in the context of water.</p>

											<h4>center of excellence</h4>
											<p>A center of excellence (CoE) is a team, a shared facility or an entity that provides leadership, best practices, research, support and/or training for a focus area. The focus area might be a technology (e.g. Java), a business concept (e.g. BPM), a skill (e.g. negotiation) or a broad area of study (e.g. women's health). A center of excellence may also be aimed at revitalizing stalled initiatives.
												Within an organization, a center of excellence may refer to a group of people, a department or a shared facility. It may also be known as a competency center or a capability center. The term may also refer to a network of institutions collaborating with each other to pursue excellence in a particular area. (e.g. the Rochester Area Colleges Center for Excellence in Math and Science).

												Stephen Jenner and Craig Kilford, in Management of Portfolios, mention CoE as a coordinating function which ensures that change initiatives are delivered consistently and well, through standard processes and competent staff.In technology companies, the center of excellence concept is often associated with new software tools, technologies or associated business concepts such as Service-oriented architecture or business intelligence. In academic institutions, a center of excellence often refers to a team with a clear focus on a particular area of research; such a center may bring together faculty members from different disciplines and provide shared facilities.</p>

									<h3>Overview</h3>
									<p>Vernacular Architecture is a little known and less explored field that is concerned with holistic architectural building traditions/practices that are cost effective, ecologically sensible and culturally relevant.Building on the work of practitioners like Laurie Baker and Hassan Fathy, our architectural practice, initiated by the late R.L. Kumar, revolves around promoting the use of locally available materials, traditional building techniques, culturally and climatically relevant building design and building a vibrant community of crafts persons.Attempting to take forward his legacy, the CVA Trust also hopes to deepen the pedagogy around those vernacular values Kumar expressed in his writings and readings through creating diverse learning and training spaces.</p>
